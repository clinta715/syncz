This is a small utility I wrote to automate my rsync based backups.  Essentially what it does is extend some bash scripts I was using to perform additional functions using a table of ChatGPT generated bash commands and substitution of strings/variables.
It's very primitive, but using SSH command is able to create a VMWare snapshot on a remote host, map the folder using sshfs, and create a zstd compressed tar file of the virtual machine which can be restored from tape/external media or uploaded to b2 (backblaze, like s3) storage.  You could also easily extend it to use sftp, ftp, s3, or any other technology just by editing some text files.
That said, it's very confusing for anyone other than the person who wrote it to use, but I use it in production for my backups.
It also has additional features like creating periodical snapshots of changed files on a folder and zip compressing them with txt description files, or zstd compressing remote folders to local archives, etc.
